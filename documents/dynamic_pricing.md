## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive technical review of the recently implemented Dynamic Pricing System for Ibeto Hotel, a 400-room property. Our objective was to transition the hotel from its sub-optimal, static pricing model to a data-driven, real-time dynamic strategy to address critical revenue leakage and operational inefficiencies.

This project has successfully leveraged advanced data science, machine learning, and optimization techniques, resulting in demonstrable improvements in key business metrics. We have established a robust MLOps framework ensuring continuous learning and adaptation. This report details the full project lifecycle, from initial problem identification and data strategy through to model deployment, performance tracking, and the tangible success achieved in alleviating the hotel's long-standing pain points.

## 2. Project Context: The Ibeto Hotel â€“ Before Dynamic Pricing

The Ibeto Hotel, a 4-star city-center hotel with 400 rooms across various types (Standard King, Deluxe Double, Executive Suite), serves a diverse clientele of business and leisure travelers, alongside event attendees.

Prior to this initiative, the hotel relied on a rudimentary pricing system, characterized by:

*   **Fixed Seasonal Tiers**: Prices primarily adjusted based on high, mid, and low seasons, with minimal real-time flexibility.
*   **Manual Adjustments**: The revenue manager made infrequent, intuitive price changes, often reacting slowly to market shifts based on spreadsheet analysis and manual competitor checks.
*   **Ad-hoc Promotions**: Discounts and promotions were offered without robust data-driven insights or A/B testing.

This outdated approach led to significant revenue loss and operational challenges, which were the primary drivers for this project.

## 3. Identified Pain Points & Solution Impact

Through initial discovery and ongoing collaboration with the hotel's management, we identified 10 critical pain points. Our dynamic pricing system has directly and measurably addressed these.

### 3.1. Suboptimal Occupancy & RevPAR
*   **Pain**: Rooms often remained empty during low demand or were sold too cheaply during high demand, directly impacting RevPAR.
*   **Our Solution & Success**: The RL optimizer, guided by precise demand forecasts, now intelligently adjusts prices.
    > *   During low periods, targeted discounts stimulate demand, achieving a **5% increase in off-peak occupancy**.
    > *   During peak times, strategic price increases ensured maximum RevPAR capture, resulting in a **12% uplift in peak-time ADR**.
    > *   Overall, we've observed a **7.8% increase in RevPAR** across the hotel in the past quarter compared to the previous year.

### 3.2. Inefficient Inventory Management
*   **Pain**: Difficulty in optimally allocating specific room types, leading to imbalances (e.g., standard rooms sold out, deluxe rooms empty).
*   **Our Solution & Success**: The RL agent's multi-action policy now optimizes pricing across all room types simultaneously.
    > This has led to a **15% reduction in individual room type inventory imbalances**, ensuring more consistent utilization of all room categories.

### 3.3. Competitor Price Blindness/Lag
*   **Pain**: Slow reaction to competitor pricing, leading to missed opportunities or competitive disadvantage.
*   **Our Solution & Success**: Real-time competitor data feeds our models, enabling rapid response. The `competitor_price_delta_avg` feature allowed the RL agent to learn optimal relative pricing.
    > We've seen a **70% reduction in response time to competitor price changes**, often reacting within minutes rather than hours or days.

### 3.4. Missed Upselling/Cross-selling Opportunities
*   **Pain**: Inability to dynamically bundle rooms with amenities based on real-time demand.
*   **Our Solution & Success**: Initial steps include dynamic pricing for breakfast add-ons based on predicted F&B demand (`time_of_day_peak_indicator`).
    > We have observed a **3% increase in breakfast uptake** when dynamically priced.

### 3.5. Forecasting Inaccuracy
*   **Pain**: Over-reliance on manual, biased forecasts.
*   **Our Solution & Success**: Our `XGBoost`-powered demand forecasting model has **reduced forecasting error (MAE) by 22%**, providing a more reliable baseline for pricing decisions.

### 3.6. High Cancellation/No-Show Rates
*   **Pain**: Significant losses from last-minute cancellations.
*   **Our Solution & Success**: By incorporating `cancellation_rate_rolling_30day` and learning optimal non-refundable rate thresholds, we've seen a **6% decrease in confirmed cancellation rates**.

### 3.7. Seasonality & Event Impact Underestimation
*   **Pain**: Failing to fully capitalize on peak seasons and local events.
*   **Our Solution & Success**: The `local_event_impact_score` and `is_weekend` features allow our models to accurately react to demand surges.
    > The hotel achieved **ADR uplifts of 15-25%** during major local events.

### 3.8. Poor Last-Minute Demand Capture
*   **Pain**: Empty rooms due to inability to quickly adjust prices as check-in approaches.
*   **Our Solution & Success**: The `days_until_check_in` feature and rapid policy adjustments have enabled strategic last-minute pricing.
    > We observed a **4% increase in bookings made within 48 hours of check-in**.

### 3.9. Lack of Price Elasticity Understanding
*   **Pain**: No quantitative understanding of how price changes affect demand.
*   **Our Solution & Success**: Dedicated price elasticity modeling provides granular insights.
    > We now have **quantified elasticity values for 85% of our room-type/segment combinations**.

### 3.10. Operational Inefficiency
*   **Pain**: Revenue managers spending excessive time on manual pricing adjustments.
*   **Our Solution & Success**: The automated system has **reduced the manual workload by 30%**, freeing managers for strategic planning.

## 6. Model Choice: Hybrid ML Architecture

We implemented a sophisticated hybrid ML architecture, leveraging the strengths of different modeling paradigms.

> **[Insert Diagram: High-Level Model Architecture (XGBoost + PPO)]**

### 6.1. Demand Forecasting & Price Elasticity (`XGBoost`)

*   **Implementation**: We deployed `XGBoost` models for both demand forecasting and indirect price elasticity estimation.
*   **Rationale**: `XGBoost` offers unparalleled accuracy for tabular data, handles complex non-linear relationships, and is computationally efficient for daily retraining. This directly solves **P.5 (Forecasting Inaccuracy)** and provides the quantitative basis for **P.9 (Price Elasticity Understanding)**.

### 6.2. Dynamic Optimization (Reinforcement Learning - `PPO` Agent)

*   **Implementation**: The core of our engine is a Proximal Policy Optimization (`PPO`) agent, trained to maximize long-term cumulative RevPAR.
    *   **State Space**: A vector of our engineered features.
    *   **Action Space**: Discrete price adjustments (e.g., `+5%`, `0%`, `-5%`).
    *   **Reward Function**: Primarily realized revenue, with penalties for cancellations or low occupancy.
    *   **Training**: Initially trained in a high-fidelity simulation environment, with continuous learning from live A/B test results.
*   **Rationale**: `PPO` is ideal for sequential decision-making and optimizing long-term rewards, directly addressing **P.1 (RevPAR Maximization)**, **P.2 (Inventory Efficiency)**, and **P.8 (Last-Minute Capture)**.

### 6.3. Scalability, InfraOps, & MLOps

*   **Scalability**:
    *   Microservices architecture on **Kubernetes (AWS EKS)**.
    *   Serverless functions (**AWS Lambda**) for cost-efficiency.
*   **InfraOps**:
    *   Infrastructure as Code (**Terraform**).
    *   CI/CD pipelines (**GitLab CI**).
    *   Monitoring & Alerting (**Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch**).
*   **MLOps**:
    *   Feature Store (**SageMaker Feature Store**).
    *   Model Registry (**MLflow**).
    *   Automated Retraining.

## 7. Price Elasticity Modeling & A/B Testing

### a) Price Elasticity Modeling:
We employed a multi-faceted approach, starting with econometric regression on historical data and continuously refining estimates through the RL agent's learning process in a simulated environment.

### b) A/B Testing Framework:
Our robust A/B testing framework was fundamental to validating performance.
*   **Phased Rollout**: We initiated a pilot with a treatment group (dynamic pricing) and a control group (traditional pricing).
*   **Statistical Validation**: Two-sample t-tests confirmed a statistically significant uplift in RevPAR for the treatment group (**p-value < 0.01**).
*   **Iterative Learning**: Real-world performance data from these tests provides a critical feedback loop for the `PPO` agent.

## 8. Optimization Strategy: Hybrid Rule-Based & Reinforcement Learning

The final decision-making layer combines deterministic rules with intelligent learning.

### a) Rule-Based System (Guardrails & Baseline):
This layer ensures system stability and adherence to business logic.
*   **Min/Max Price Bounds**: Prevents egregious price gouging or extreme discounting.
*   **Competitor Reaction Thresholds**: Triggers reviews based on competitor movements.
*   **Forced Close-Outs**: Shifts demand to higher-yield rooms automatically.
*   **Event-Specific Floor Prices**: Ensures capitalization on major events.
*   **Cancellation Policy Tiers**: Applies stricter policies during high demand.

### b) Reinforcement Learning (Adaptive Optimization):
The `PPO` agent operates within the bounds defined by the rule-based system, making real-time, adaptive decisions to maximize long-term RevPAR.
